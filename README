FfmpegBase2.py is a base class that will encode the given list of files to a ps3
compatiable h.264 + AAC mpeg4 file. The default output is to the console.
That is all this does at the moment no more, no less. It does the encode in a 
seprate thread that allows event loops *cough*QT*cough* to run. It communicates
to the UI thread via a UDP socket on localhost. Support me be added in the 
future to run the encode on one machine and the UI on another.
No support for that is planed at the moment.

An additional class will be added to provide a QT4||GTK2+ gui for a progress
bar and graphical file chooser later, and maybe a basic dvd ripper.
