ps3enc2.py is a base class that will encode the given list of files to a ps3 
compatiable h.264 + AAC mpeg4 file. The default output is to the console. That is all this does at the moment no more, no less.

An additional class will be added to provide a QT4||GTK2+ gui for a progress
bar and graphical file chooser later.
